# General background information {background-color="#4BB694"}

## Cancer touches everyone directly or indirectly. {.center}

## Cancer is the uncontrolled growth of our cells. {.center}

## Uncontrolled growth is driven by the accumalation of mutations in our genes. {.center}

## The gene can be considered the basic unit of inheritance.<br><br>Genes are sequences of nucleic acids using a four letter alphabet to encode information.{.center}

## The central dogma of biology is that DNA is transcribed to RNA, and RNA is translated to proteins.<br><br>Along with fats, sugars, salt and water, this is essentially what we and our cells are physically. {.center}

## In fact only about 1.5% of our genes code for protein.<br><br>Proteins use 20 letter amino acid alaphbet. {.center}

## Mutations occur spontaneouly and from environmental exposure that damages our DNA. When our cells divide and renew, the new cells inherits the mutated DNA. The longer one lives or does certain behaviours, the more chance for mutations. {.center}

## Treatments are still largely based around poision, burning or cutting. They aim to remove or prevent fast dividing cells continuing.<br><br>These are blunt tools and are unpleasant to undergo. {.center}

## In the 1970s we invented antibody technology and have since designed molecules to bind to receptors on certain types of cancer to inhibit their growth. These came into use around 2000. {.center}

## In the 2000s we developed antibody treatments targeting immune system cells to help our immune system recognise and kill cancer. {.center}

## But given the random aspect of mutations and side effects of existing treatments, the challenge is to target treatment better and create more personalised treatments.<br><br>We are now entering the age of cancer vaccines. {.center}

## Re-cap {.center}
Genes get mutated and encode information. 

. . .

Proteins are gene products, hence a mutation in a gene can be translated into a mutated protein. 

. . .

Historically medicines generally target proteins, and proteins are the what the immune system sees. 

# Lung cancer {background-color="#4BB694"}

In the UK, 70% of lung cancers are the result of smoking. It is usually diagnosed late which contributes to poor survivability.

. . .

Around 50,000 people are diagnosed each year. 

. . .

Less than 20% of all lung cancer patients survive for 5 years, with the majority of patients surviving less than one year post-diagnosis.

## Multiomics {.center}

+  [-ome]{.vonrestoff} is the suffix for whole e.g. genome is the whole set of genes of an organism
+ Using patients tissue we examined their exome, transcriptome, proteome and immunopeptidome
+ The aim is to identify individual mutations that would make cancer vaccines and cancer subtype charateristics that could be used for diagnosis

## In other words, we seek to make sense of the information stored inside patient tissues, but there is a lot of information.<br><br>Hence (bio)informatics[*]{.highlight} {.center}

# [A GPT is a dataset!]{.vonrestoff} {.center}

At least that's how I prefer to think of it.<br>Ok, but so what?

## The mental model of a GPT as a dataset helps me think about it's strengths and weaknessess.

- A GPT is amazing at organisational transformations of the complex data it contains and responding to natural language prompts.
- A GPT is very bad at abstraction or out-of-sample questions i.e. about things not in its dataset.
- A GPT doesn't neccessarily know the provenance of its data.

## Part of training is through reinforcement

Hence the "desire to please" that generates hallucinations and part of why they all have a different vibe. 

## What does that look like in practice

I favour Claude, but [LMSYS Chatbot Arena](https://chat.lmsys.org/) is good place to compare outputs from the same prompt.

If it's on the internet there's a good chance it's part of the training dataset.

## What technology doesn't change

- ABC
- Certainty and truth are consequence of the accumalation of information. Single experiments or pieces of information rarely if ever definitively answer a question.
